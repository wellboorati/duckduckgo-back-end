# API DuckDuckGo - Back-End

This is the back-end of the DuckDuckGo search API project, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wellboorati/duckduckgo-back-end.git
cd api-duckduckgo
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have **Yarn** installed, then run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure it as needed:

```sh
PORT=3000
```

### **4. Run the Application Locally**

To start the development server with auto-reload:

```sh
yarn start:dev
```

To start the server:

```sh
yarn start
```

To start the production build:

```sh
yarn build
node dist/index.js
```

### **5. Running Tests**

Run unit and integration tests using Jest:
